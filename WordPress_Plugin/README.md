# Raspberry-Weather-WordPress
Wordpress plugin that reads and displays readings taken with your weather station

In order to use this plugin, download the source code on your right. You will be presented with a zip file, which needs to be imported in your Wordpress site. Navigate to your dashboard, Plugins and select Add new. In the top click on Upload plugin and upload the downloaded zip. Afterwards only enable the plugin and you're good to go!

The PressureWind branch(http://goo.gl/rkpABa) created by A. Catorcini is an expansion to the basic functionalities. Take a look if you want to display wind speed and barometric pressure! 

The PressureWind plugin did not work for me, but [the original plugin](https://github.com/peterkodermac/Raspberry-Weather-WordPress) did, so I modified the original to incule pressure.
